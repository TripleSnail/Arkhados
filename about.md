Arkhados is fast paced multiplayer action PvP arena game where players move around and try to kill each other by casting various spells. Arkhados is entirely skill based, meaning that there is no automatic targeting and no random elements like critical strike chance or dodge chance.

Arkhados is very fast paced. There are no mana costs and arenas are quite small which makes gameplay very fast. Games usually last less than 10 minutes.

Arkhados currently supports only deathmatch but teamplay will be added later and I believe that it will be the most enjoyable game mode for Arkhados.
