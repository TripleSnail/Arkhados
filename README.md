# JMageBattle #

JMageBattle is fast paced MOBA game where mages cast entirely skill based spells to kill each other.
It's programmed in Java with JMonkeyEngine 3.


**NOTE:** This is my initial commit. I will add more information later.

## Credits ##

William Linna for programming.

Thanks for MonkeyZone developers for providing example multiplayer
game. I copied two source files from it and made small changes. I
retained their original license for that reason.

Thanks for Clement Wu, Nikolaus & Botanic for Mage-model. Mage-model
is multilicensed, one of them is CC-BY 3.0 which I use for this. I've
made slight changes to model. See
http://opengameart.org/content/animated-mage for original model.

Thanks to friends for giving ideas.

## License ##

JMageBattle is GPLv3 licensed, except for two files that I copied from MonkeyZone
