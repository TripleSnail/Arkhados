# JMageBattle #

JMageBattle is MOBA game where mages cast spells to kill each other.
It's programmed in Java with JMonkeyEngine 3.

Gameplay is highly influenced by Warcraft III mod called "Warlock Brawl".

I'm bit new to Java and JMonkeyEngine and I'm developing JMageBattle
only on my free time so progress may be slow. However, I've been able
to develop JMageBattle little bit every day.

**NOTE:** This is my initial commit. I will add more information later.

## Credits ##

William Linna for programming.

Thanks for Warlock Brawl -developers for making one of my favourite
Warcraft III -mod. Because of Warlock Brawl, I decided to start
developing JMageBattle. http://www.warlockbrawl.com/

Thanks for MonkeyZone developers for providing example multiplayer
game. I copied two source files from it and made small changes. I
retained their original license for that reason.

Thanks for Clement Wu, Nikolaus & Botanic for Mage-model. Mage-model
is multilicensed, one of them is CC-BY 3.0 which I use for this. I've
made slight changes to model. See

Thanks to friends for giving ideas.
