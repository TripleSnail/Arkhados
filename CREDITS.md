MonkeyZone developers for providing example multiplayer
game. I copied two source files from it and made small changes. I
retained their original license of course.

Clement Wu, Nikolaus & Botanic for Mage-model. Mage-model
is multilicensed, one of them is CC-BY 3.0 which I use for this. I've
made slight changes to model. See
http://opengameart.org/content/animated-mage for original model.

Dakal for Ember Circle's texture and Saroman for original texture that Dakal's texture is based on. Both are CC-BY 3.0 licensed. Dakal's texture can be found from [here](http://opengameart.org/node/10483)
