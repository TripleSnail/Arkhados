MonkeyZone developers for providing example multiplayer
game. I copied two source files from it and made small changes. I
retained their original license of course.

Clement Wu, Nikolaus & Botanic for Mage-model. Mage-model
is multilicensed, one of them is CC-BY 3.0 which I use for this. I've
made slight changes to model. See

created animations. Original model (without animations) can be found from [Blendswap](http://www.blendswap.com/blends/view/56015)

texture is based on. Both are CC-BY 3.0 licensed. Dakal's texture can be found
